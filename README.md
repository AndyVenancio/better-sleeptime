# SleepTime App

A simple web application similar to [sleepyti.me] (https://sleepyti.me/) but limited to siggesting "wake up" tomes based on calculating sleep cycles.

- A sleep cycle lasts about 90 minutes, and a good night's sleep consists of 5-6 sleep cycles. 

- If you wake up in the middle of a sleep cycle, you will feel groggy even if you've completed several sleep cycles before waking up.

This app is made of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
